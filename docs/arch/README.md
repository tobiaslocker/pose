# Architecture Documentation Index

This folder documents the current system architecture and key design decisions.
It loosely follows Arc42 and uses [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) diagrams for visualization.

## Files

- [Context](./context.md): What the system is and how it fits into its environment
- [Components](./components.md): Main parts/modules and their responsibilities
- [Runtime](./runtime.md): Optional scenarios of dynamic behavior
- [Deployment](./deployment.md): Overview of deployment and communication setup
- [Decisions](./decisions/): Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Diagrams

PlantUML diagrams are located in `./diagrams/`.
You can render them with the PlantUML VS Code plugin or CLI.
