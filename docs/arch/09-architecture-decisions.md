# 9. Architecture Decisions

// Start recording simple Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

// Example first entries:

## ADR-001: Use of FlatBuffers
Reason: Efficient serialization for real-time pose streaming.

## ADR-002: Use of Bevy ECS
Reason: Flexible and performant game architecture supporting WebAssembly.

## ADR-003: DetectionProvider abstraction
Reason: Required to support multiple types of detection pipelines (Python server, JS bridge, mobile app, embedded).
